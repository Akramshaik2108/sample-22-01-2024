        <p style="text-align: justify;">standpoint of attracting students to their degree programs. Both chairs and
deans strongly rejected the concept of offering degrees, in any academic
            discipline, entirely over the Internet.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Independent study courses, such as Internet courses, typically lack the
structure, deadlines, and regular face-to-face student-instructor interaction that traditional courses possess. Most would agree that some topics
are more easily learned through independent study than are others.
Perhaps all that the respondents are conveying is that structure, deadlines,
and student-faculty interaction are more important in accounting and
                business topics than in other areas.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondents can be grouped by whether or not they agree that “except for
the delivery medium Internet courses are essentially correspondence courses.”
Roughly 2 1/2 times as many chairs agreed with the statement as those who
disagreed (64.9 % to 25.3%), while the deans were about evenly split. Those
who agree with this statement are more negative on offering Internet courses
in university programs or offering degrees through the completion of only
Internet courses. They are also more restrictive with Internet courses, favoring
the proctoring of exams and requiring students to come to campus as part of
the Internet course. The average number of campus visits recommended by
the 39 chairs (42% of total) who responded to that statement was 5.54 visits
per course. The 43 deans who entered a number (65% of the 66 responding)
recommended an average of 2.77 campus visits for a three-hour course. Those
who viewed Internet courses as correspondence courses also tended to agree
that “the student-to-student and the student-to-instructor interaction that are
                missing in E courses makes them less valuable to the student.”</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the view of the nearly 65% of the chairs and almost half of the deans
is accurate and Internet courses are simply correspondence courses presented
with new technology, then will they be more successful in the university
paradigm than correspondence courses have been? Experience teaches that
successful completion of correspondence courses requires a level of dedication that many do not possess. Degree programs in technical areas have been
available from some colleges for decades, and they have not challenged the
existence of the formal university. Technical knowledge can usually be best
learned in a do-it-yourself environment, such as that provided by a vocationaltechnical school. If the objective is to simply gain technical knowledge,
probably few professors would assert that a university setting is either
                required or is necessarily the best setting.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Traditionally, universities have awarded degrees to students who satisfied “educational” requirements by successfully completing courses in a
broad-based curriculum. Universities are challenged to develop students’ interpersonal and group skills and to teach students how to “think critically.”
Meeting these particular challenges would seem to be next to impossible
when a student never has direct, face-to-face contact with either an instructor
or other students, as in the pure Internet course degree program. That is not to
say that Internet courses may not have a role to play in complementing the
traditional university degree program, just as correspondence courses have
                had, but supplanting the traditional university, hardly.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the basis of the current research, Noam’s view of “the dim future
of the university” may be more hype than substance. Surely universities
will change, such is called evolution. Surely the new technology will be
integrated into the university paradigm, but it is unlikely that “this system
of higher education [that has] remained stable for more than 2,500 years”
(Noam, 1996, p. 7) will be discarded to be replaced by the Internet. At least
accounting chairpersons and COB deans don’t seem to think so. That
conclusion is supported by the results of a study (Hagan & Omolayole,
2000) of 3,600 business professors teaching in various colleges in the US.
They appear to recognize Internet courses as correspondence courses
                delivered over the Internet.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The question may well be, “are Internet courses simply correspondence
courses in new packaging?” Have universities taken an academic concept that
garnered limited acceptance in the past, wrapped it in the glitzy attire of
Internet technology, and presented it as the pedagogical discovery of the
century? By more than a 2 1/2 to 1 margin (64.8 % to 25.3%) the accounting
chairpersons responding to the survey appear to think so. Almost half of the
                COB deans responding appear to agree.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the traditional university will face some challenges from the
distance learning revolution, evidence suggests that its survival will not be in
jeopardy. Rather, the challenge may well be integrating the new technology
without significantly diminishing the quality of the educational process.
Proctored exams and noting on the transcript which courses or degrees have
                been completed as distance learning courses may be essential.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A Bible story relates that men do not put new wine in old bottles because
the aging process will burst the bottles. Instead, new wine is placed in new
bottles to preserve the wine. There is little doubt that Internet courses
represent new bottles, a new delivery system. The question remains, however,
“are Internet courses old wine in new packaging?” Have universities taken an
academic concept that garnered limited acceptance in the past, wrapped it in
the glitzy attire of Internet technology, and presented it as the pedagogical
                discovery of the century?</p><br>

Education: Pick Fruit From
The Low-Hanging Branches
</h1>  
        <p style="text-align: center;">Kim E. Dooley and Jane Magill
            Texas A&M University, USA</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>The environment for higher education has become much more
dynamic and even more complex with the recent development of new
                digital technologies</i> (Hanna, 1999, p. 25).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Motivating faculty members to teach at a distance has been a challenge
for most colleges and universities. What will be the impact of teaching using
technology on faculty responsibility? Is teaching students through any or all
distance education methods really nothing more than adapting traditional
classroom approaches? What are the attitudes and barriers to using technologies often associated with distance education? In this chapter the authors
present data obtained from an extensive survey of faculty opinions on
teaching at a distance, as well as several case studies describing incentives and
training made available for distance education. To enhance participation in
distance education, faculty must have the competence, attitude that distance
education is important and valuable, and infrastructure available to facilitate
the additional time and effort to convert courses. Faculty training programs
cannot be “one-shot” and should include personnel in close proximity to
faculty, preferable on their own equipment. Release time is an important
            incentive to encourage participation.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">INTRODUCTION
</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1989, Connie Dillon addressed the perceptions of faculty participation in
instructional telecommunications. Her study provided insight into the factors that
influence the integration of telecommunications teaching within the higher
education system. A decade has passed and many higher education institutions are
still struggling to integrate and utilize distance education technologies. The
                technologies have changed, but faculty attitudes often remain the same.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To prepare students successfully for today’s digital marketplace, educators should incorporate the use of information technologies. “Educators must
help all students become adept at distanced interaction, for skills of information gathering from remote sources and of collaboration with dispersed team
members are as central to the future American workplace as learning to
perform structured tasks quickly was to the industrial revolution” (Dede,
1996, p. 30). Students learn from competent instructors who have been trained
how to communicate effectively through the technology. Thomas Cyrs (1997)
identifies areas of competence important to a distance education environment: course planning and organization, verbal and nonverbal presentation
skills, collaborative teamwork, questioning strategies, subject matter expertise, involving students and coordinating their activities at field sites, knowledge of basic learning theory, knowledge of the distance learning field, design
of study guides, graphic design and visual thinking (Cyrs, 1997). LacinaGifford and J.-Kher-Durlabhji (1996) emphasized that instructors must be
part of a change process in their role as instructors if distance learning is to be
successful. The authors also mentioned that the students attributed the success
of the program to user-friendly technology and the promptness of the
                instructor in communicating with the students.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Linda Wolcott (1997) conducted an analysis of the institutional context
and dynamics of faculty rewards at research universities. She discovered that
1) distance education occupies a marginal status, 2) distance teaching is
neither highly valued nor well-rewarded as a scholarly activity, 3) distance
teaching is not highly related to promotion and tenure decisions, and 4)
rewards for distance teaching are dependent on the academic unit’s commitment to distance education. Faculty barriers stem for the lack of perceived
institutional support (faculty rewards, incentives, training, etc.) for course
conversion to distance education formats (Dillon & Walsh, 1992; McKenzie,
Mims, Bennett, & Waugh, 2000; Wolcott, 1997; Olcott & Wright, 1995). Part
of this support may include release time for course preparation. Reports
indicate that teaching at a distance takes more time than teaching a traditional
course (NEA, 2000; McKenzie, Mims, Bennett, & Waugh, 2000; Rockwell,
                Schauer, Fritz, & Marx, 1999; Visser, 2000).</p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The need for a change and modification of the faculty role in teaching at
a distance has been recognized (Dillon & Walsh, 1992; Layzell, 1996; Plater,
1995; Purdy & Wright, 1992; Schifter, 2000). “It is not that the technology
underpinning distance education drives the system but rather that fundamental changes in teaching style, technique, and motivation must take place to
make the new ‘classrooms’ of the present and future function effectively”
             (Purdy & Wright, 1992, p. 4).</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite the fact that much of the literature in distance education discusses the
importance of faculty, this group has been largely neglected by the research
                (Dillon & Walsh, 1992; Beaudoin, 1990). Beaudoin (1990) observes that:</p>
            <ul><p style="text-align: justify;">[t]he emergence of increasingly student-centered learning activities
in the 1970s facilitated by new instructional technology introduced
in the 1980s is contributing to a dramatic evolution in faculty roles,
and raises fundamental questions within the professoriate about how
it will contribute to the teaching-learning process in the 1990s and
                beyond. (p. 21)</p></ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As indicated by Moore (1997) in his comparison of distance education,
programs with a commitment to faculty support and training result in higher
quality. Institutions that are involved in, or currently moving into the realm of
distance education can benefit from the discussions in this chapter. As the
complexity continues and the desire to integrate distance education programs
                expands, attention must be given to faculty training and support.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In consideration of this incredible growth and increased complexity, what
will be the impact of teaching using technology on faculty responsibility? Is
teaching students through any or all distance education methods really nothing
more than adapting traditional classroom approaches? What are the attitudes and
                barriers to using technologies often associated with distance education?</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This chapter is divided into two major sections. The first provides a
glimpse of faculty perceptions about teaching at a distance based upon several
research studies conducted at Texas A&M University. The second section
will provide case studies of actual faculty training, support, and incentives
that were implemented to encourage faculty to participate in teaching at a
                distance—some that worked and some that didn’t.</p><br>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">FACULTY PERCEPTIONS OF TEACHING AT A
DISTANCE</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The changing student population, rapid technological advances, and the
economic issues facing higher education are creating an accelerated demand
for learning anytime, anyplace. The ability of an organization to adapt to these changes will be influenced by at least three factors: a) the knowledge, skills, and abilities of its faculty/staff, b) the amount of importance
placed on distance learning technologies to accomplish teaching and
learning, and c) the availability of high-quality facilities, equipment,
                technical support, and training.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At Texas A&M University, distance education began in the early 1990s
with the development of the Trans-Texas Videoconference Network (TTVN).
There are now over 100 interactive video sites across the state and in two
international locations (Mexico City, Mexico and San Jose, Costa Rica). The
network initially was a means to connect all the components of the Texas
A&M University System administratively. By the mid 1990s, faculty who had
been teaching in off-campus programs began teaching courses on the network
and today there are six Masters degrees and one Joint Doctor of Education
degree offered entirely at a distance. Additionally, the university adopted
WebCT in 1998 and faculty began to include more web-based components in
                their courses and degree programs.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the College of Agriculture and Life Science, there is currently a Master
of Agriculture Degree with three content options (Natural Resource Development, Interdisciplinary Science, and Agricultural Development) and the Joint
Doctor of Education in Agricultural Education degree offered with Texas
Tech University. Recent studies were conducted to provide baseline data for
faculty perceptions of electronic technologies used in teaching and to determine the rate of adoption of distance education as an innovation (Dooley &
Murphy, 2001; Dooley & Murphrey, 2000; Murphrey & Dooley, 2000; Poe,
2000). The studies include both quantitative and qualitative data collection
procedures and analysis, and provide the basis for recommendations to
                encourage faculty participation in distance education.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the Dooley and Murphy study (2001), all teaching faculty in the
College of Agriculture and Life Science (15 departments) were surveyed
(N=315). The instrument used to collect data was a three-part questionnaire
designed by the researchers. Part I of the questionnaire was designed to
identify the characteristics and level of involvement of the respondents in
technology-mediated instruction. Part II was designed to measure faculty
competence, value and quality of infrastructure with a five-point Likert
response scale. Part III consisted of three open-ended questions designed to
provide an opportunity for the respondents to add their comments concerning
                the improvement of their use of distance education technologies.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all, 263 survey instruments were returned for a final response rate of
84%. Survey and follow-up procedures were in accordance with those
outlined by Dillman (1978). Descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable. Frequencies and percentages were used to summarize agreement or disagreement with each of the statements related to competence, value, and quality of infrastructure. An attempt to control nonrespondent error was made by comparing the data from early and late
respondents as suggested by Miller and Smith (1983). No significant
                differences were found between the groups.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The constant comparative method was used for the open-ended,
qualitative data analysis (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Colored markers were
used to differentiate respondent themes so that the data would remain in
context and provide visual indications of emerging categories. Delimiting
the construction occurred as the data sources became saturated and the
                categories were integrated.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this study, over one-half the faculty members reported having a
website related to their course. Of these, 84% were described as simply
enhancing the course, 15% were described as a required component of the
course, and .7% (1 course) was described as being completely delivered via
                the website.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Almost exactly half the faculty with a course website administer that site
themselves. Less than one-quarter assign a graduate assistant to the task.
Almost as many (21%) use professional support staff. Most of these course
websites reside administratively near the faculty members on their departmental servers (62%), and on university servers (21%). Faculty members
were almost evenly split on the software used to edit these websites, with 32%
using a text editor, and 28% using Microsoft Word. Only 5% use Microsoft
                FrontPage, while 23% report using “other” software.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While many of the teaching faculty had websites, few had experience
teaching learners at a distance. Only 1% had taught a course at a distance more
than ten times. Another 10% had taught at a distance between two and ten
times, while 9% had taught at a distance once. Almost 80% of the faculty
members responding to the survey indicated that they had never taught a class
                to learners at a distance.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eleven items on the questionnaire were used to measure the perceived
level of competence that respondents possessed in the use of electronic
technologies often associated with distance education. The faculty indicated
that they were able to use many of these technologies. Almost two-thirds of
the faculty indicated they agreed or strongly agreed that they could create their
own presentation graphics, while less than a quarter disagreed or strongly
disagreed. A clear majority of the faculty members (84%) agreed or strongly
agreed that they used email for “almost all of my correspondence,” while 29%
agreed or strongly agreed that they would send their “most important or confidential” documents through email.” A majority of the faculty members
(59%) agreed or strongly agreed that they could “scan photographs into digital
files,” while 29% disagreed or strongly disagreed. Nearly one-half agreed or
strongly agreed that they were able to “connect a computer to the various
output devices available (LCD projector, TV, etc.).” By a narrow margin, the
faculty members agreed that they could “manipulate digital images” (46%
agreed or strongly agreed vs. 43% disagreed or strongly disagreed). Slightly
over one-half agreed or strongly agreed that they could “confidently deliver
                my course over the videoconferencing equipment.”</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While many of the faculty members were fairly confident in their ability
to use presentation software, email, and digital images in their teaching, they
also identified areas in which they were not as confident. Over one-half of the
faculty members disagreed or strongly disagreed that they could create their
own web page. Only a handful agreed (7%) or strongly agreed (3%) with the
statement, “I am able to record and use digital sound in my presentations.”
Nearly two-thirds disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement, “I could
                confidently deliver my course on the web.”</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Faculty members had much more confidence in their technical competence than they did in their methodological ability to use these technologies
in their teaching. Over one-half of the respondents disagreed or strongly
disagreed with the statement, “I am familiar with the teaching methods
                appropriate for distance learning.”</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nine items were used to measure value, i.e., the importance of the role
respondents believed these technologies have or will have to teaching
agriculture. An overwhelming majority of the faculty members strongly
agreed and agreed with the statement, “The Internet/WWW are convenient
ways to access information.” Nearly half agreed or strongly agreed with the
statement, “Participation in listservs, threaded discussion groups, chats and
other electronic communications offers great benefits.” The respondents
agreed (40%) and strongly agreed (18%) that most course materials could be
improved by incorporating multimedia. They agreed (40%) and strongly
agreed (18%) that “Animated graphics increase student interest and retention.” Almost exactly two-thirds of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed
that “Students today prefer a more visual learning experience.” Over threequarters of those responding agreed or strongly agreed that “Electronic
information technologies provide students with instantly available supplemental course and research materials.” Over one-half agreed or strongly
                agreed that “It is important that I incorporate electronic information technologies in the courses I teach.”</p>
